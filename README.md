###Java Remote Administration Tool

There are two projects, the client and the server
they're both eclipse projects, just import them and 
compile them to create the Client.jar and Server.jar

Run the server on the desired computer/server you want to connect to
Then run the client on your computer, where you want to connect from

(you can do both on the same computer, just use localhost to connect)

type help for commands
